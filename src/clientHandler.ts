// what would join be classified as, for when the client shares its username with the server?

// join can be shared because the client will say hey i'm joining with this username,
// then the server will emit that same event back to the clients saying, hey everyone this guy joined with this username

// the reason move isn't shared is because clients should not be able to tell the server which username moved

// no you don't want those 


// i know, but without them the animations break. i dont know 100% how to fix our player class to not need them
// events that that come from the client, also we need the velocity, and xAccel,

// you should just send isJumping and direction from the server then
// just have the server compute that stuff once and send it to all the clients,
// rather than giving all the clients the info and having them compute it

// there is no desync if the server is the source of truth
// if you're having performance issues that is causing stuff like rubberbanding it's an issue of either the code
// or the connection

// socketio will fallback to http if it can't establish the websocket

// so you should use the network tab to check that the websocket is properly established and its not falling back to http
// ok

// i might just ask u to help after i get home, so i dont cut into ur work time

// im on lunch
// ok!

// so a few things is if each method is loopthing through all the game objects and stuff

// my friends are asking wouldn't that cause rubberbanding? because idk, they said it could desync?

// and isJumping, and direction

// btw i hate the player class, i know it does too much
