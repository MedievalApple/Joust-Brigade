## Description

Step into the nostalgia of the classic Joust arcade experience, reimagined seamlessly for the browser environment. Our adaptation leverages the power of TypeScript and Webpack to faithfully bring the essence of the original Joust game to the online realm. In the iconic Joust game, players mounted on flying ostriches engage in thrilling aerial jousting matches. Our web version not only preserves the excitement of the original but also breaks barriers by enabling an unlimited number of players to join from different machines. Immerse yourself in the timeless charm of Joust, now with the added thrill of a boundless, interconnected player experience.

## Vision and Future Plans

At Joust Brigade, our vision surpasses mere recreation; we are dedicated to the continual expansion and enhancement of the gaming experience. In our development pipeline, we are in the process of adding a range of diverse game modes meticulously crafted to cater to various playstyles and preferences.

### 1. **1v1 Mode:**
   First on the list is the 1v1 mode, a strategic showdown where players engage in one-on-one battles against a single human opponent. This mode intensifies the strategic element by eliminating the interference of additional enemies, providing a focused and challenging experience.

### 2. **Free-for-All (FFA) Mode:**
   Another exciting addition to our repertoire is the Free-for-All (FFA) mode. In this mode, the skies transform into a chaotic battleground as multiple players compete for supremacy. Brace yourself for the exhilarating challenge of navigating a dynamic and unpredictable environment.

Stay tuned as we actively evolve and enrich the Joust Brigade. We're dedicated to delivering exciting updates and introducing engaging gameplay options that will keep you hooked and entertained.
